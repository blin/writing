# Reading, notes, spaced repetition

Over the last year, I've stumbled on a series of texts that
together changed how I approach learning.

"How to take smart notes" [^smart-notes]
introduced me to the idea that reading a text is insufficient
to understand the ideas in the text.
The suggested solution is, in short: write about what you read.
Slightly more specifically:
create a densely connected network of notes based on what you read.

"Why books don’t work" [^andy-books]
re-iterates the "reading is insufficient" point,
but also suggests that one needs more than to write, one must also remember.
This text suggests using Spaced Repetition as a learning mechanism:
you read, you write cards, you memorize cards using Spaced Repetition Software.

"How to write good [Spaced Repetition] prompts" [^andy-prompts]
describes the practical aspects of learning using Spaced Repetition.
"good" Spaced Repetition prompts need to be factored
into a, surprise-surprise, dense network!

Taken together: read, write prompts, try to answer prompts, fail,
write more (smaller, connected) prompts.
Over time you turn what you've read into
a densely connected network of notes that you remember.

## What I have learned

Here are some things I've "learned" over the last year:

* Why "Land Value Tax" is great, according to Henry George.
* Bayes' rule, especially the "Bayes factor" version.
  Remembering the "Table of Confusion" helps!
* Proofs of propositions in Euclid's book of elements.
  Took me two days to write up the prompts for "point reflection".
  Twist: "point reflection" is usually not a "reflection".
* Knitting (a bit)! This one is trickiest so far.
  Most of the knitting instruction is visual,
  making it symbolic (my preferred format for remembering things)
  is a challenge.
